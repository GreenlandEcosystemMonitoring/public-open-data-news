Data delivery to GEM is open again for 2022 data, following the same schedule as previous years:

>  
> - ClimateBasis data is first priority - march 2023 if possible
> - Data from the other subprogrammes - by may 2023
> - Unless you have to retrieve it manually from loggers during the field season or for other reasons can't deliver until later in the year. 
>  
  
Before data delivery, it's a good idea to write me jkr@ecos.au.dk, so we can plan and structure it and get it right from the beginning.

## Changes / Data Delivery Procedure
We are slightly changing and improving the import process. Don't be alarmed or unsure about how to deliver data, assistance is available as much as needed. Be aware that the new GEM Programme Managers Tool is now launched in a first version:

[GEM Programme Managers Tool online](https://programmemanager.g-e-m.dk)

Here you can see general statistics, as well as a list of all your datasets and when they were last updated. You can also export metadata if you wish to update it and deliver it back along with your monitoring data files. If you have ideas for functionality, write me or post an issue on github.

<em>**Important, note how to approach this years data delivery**</em>

**1. If you are unsure or new to delivering data:**
  - Write me to get started and we will start a guided process.

**2. If you are used to working with the structured metadata files (elements and columns files):**
  - It's important that you don't update and deliver old metadata files located on your own drives. Go to the GEM Programme Managers tool and export your the latest metadata files for your subprogramme. This will include DOIs and other information in the files that I otherwise have to add manually. Once you have downloaded the metadata, you can edit it and deliver it back along with your data files for import.

<em>Remember, the Dropbox method for delivering files is no longer in use.</em> Smaller files you are welcome to send by mail, otherwise the primary data delivery method is via SFTP - guide here: [How to Deliver Data to GEM](https://github.com/GreenlandEcosystemMonitoring/participants-docs/blob/main/sftp%20data%20delivery.md)

## New Datasets / Data Curation
If you / your collaborators have GEM related datasets you have not previously submitted, you can always contact me and we will find a way to include them directly or indirectly in the GEM database.
